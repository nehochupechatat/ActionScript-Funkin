# ActionScript Funkin (aka Diet Funkin)
Simple FNF engine clone using ActionScript. Programmed like it's 2002! 

The .fla file includes a very simple demo "week" showing very basic gameplay capabilities.

Due to ActionScript 2 limitations, some things like the "ratio bar" aren't implemented.

### Benefits 

- Entire game would be stored in 1 SWF file!
- Clone can be played online using Ruffle!
- You can do cool stuff with the arrows!
- Truly scalable vector sprites!
- If you can tween, you can make weeks!

### **Build Dependencies**

Macromedia Flash 8 (or any version after that, but before Flash CC 2013)

### **Running**
Will work on Ruffle. Requires capabilities of at least Flash Player 5. 

(if you add epic parallax, vcam and video, that would require Flash Player 6 capabilities)

### **Modding**

You mod by importing your song as a WAV/MP3, adding it to streaming. 

For charting and opponent singing, you just have to tween the arrows.

If you reach the Flash 16000 frame limit, just store your week in a movie clip.

If you want your mod to work with Ruffle, DO NOT USE BLURRING, GLOWING OR ANY OTHER FILTERS!

If you want your mod graphics to be small, optimize your graphics using Modify > Shape > Optimize. Use bitmaps sparsingly.
