# ActionScript-Funkin
Simple FNF engine clone using ActionScript. Programmed like it's 2002! 


### **Build Dependencies**

Macromedia Flash 8 (or any version after that, but before Flash CC 2013)


### **Modding**

You mod by importing your song as a WAV/MP3, adding it to streaming. 

For charting and opponent singing, you just have to tween the arrows.

If you reach the Flash 16000 frame limit, just store your week in a movie clip.

If you want your mod to work with Ruffle, DO NOT USE BLURRING, GLOWING OR ANY OTHER FILTERS!

### **Running**
Will work on Ruffle. Requires capabilities of at least Flash Player 6.
